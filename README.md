### Thesis on Shor's Quantum algorithm to find discrete logarithm
This is my bachelor degree thesis. It was my first attempt with Q# and I didn't have a computer strong enough to execute the program (I should have seen it coming) so in the code there may be some errors.
I want to share my work with the hope that it could help someone get in this field as some other works helped me.

To install the libraries and everything needed to execute the code see the documentation at this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/index?view=qsharp-preview).

I'm sorry but the thesis is in italian and I've currently no time to translate it, but in the bibliography section of the document there are all the paper and research that I used to study and they are all in english.
